# MBoutique

## The MBoutique webstite originally contained four seperate pages:
  * Welcome
  * Our Macarons
  * Gifts & Parties
  * Contact

## Single Page Application
  * I used Angular Routes to convert the site to a SPA with four different states

### Project Notes
  * This project initially was all about html and css
  * The layout was provided in a design document
